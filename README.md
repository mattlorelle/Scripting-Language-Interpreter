# Scripting-Language-Interpreter
This project in a simple implementation of a scripting language interpreter and compiler. It was developed in java using intelliJ and also utilizes the JUnit 5 testing framework. Thus far, we have lexed the raw input into a list of tokens and then those tokens are parsed using an abstract syntax tree (AST) according to the specific grammar of this project. The code/files in which I actually wrote are the Lexer.java and Parser.java files
